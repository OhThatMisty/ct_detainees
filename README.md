Capstone 1 for Springboard, CT Pretrial Detainees

<b>Overview:</b>

Connecticut intended 2016’s “An Act Concerning Pretrial Justice Reform” to reform cash bond requirements and reduce lengths of stay while awaiting trial for some non-violent misdemeanors.  Did Connecticut’s pre-Act bond requirements also show bias involving immutable characteristics?  Are Connecticut Bail Fund’s concerns about “An Act Concerning Pretrial Justice Reform” valid?  Are some Connecticut residents still being held by the state without a trial because they can’t afford bail?

My analysis primarily checks for existing biases and tests the post-bill versus the pre-bill data to provide some insight into the effectiveness of the bill.
